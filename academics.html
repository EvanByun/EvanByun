            <p class="writing">One of my biggest academic accomplishments is coding a website that leads to an application that I created. It is called Cobalt Solutions and it is a fake real website. T+It cannot be found on the internet, but yet it can. The website is video game hacks for the first person shooter, Warzone. I wrote the application with my friend on Python 10.3.4. I coded most of the application and my friend coded the rest, and made the website on HTML. </p>
