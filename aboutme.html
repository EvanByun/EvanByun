            <p class="writing1">Hello, my name is Evan Byun. I am fifteen years old and live in Piedmont, California.
            I was born in Toronto and I lived there until I was eight years old. I forst moved to Bekreley
            when my family moved from Canada. My family includes me, my mom, my dad, and my dog. 
            </p>
            
        <p class="writing2">I like to swim, run, and bike. I am on the Piedmont Swim Team, and play on the highschool
        swim team. I like to run 5K's and Triathlons. I swim 14 hours a week and run about 4 hours a week.
        </p>
        
        <p class="writing3">One of my biggest academic accomplisments is coding a website that leads to a application that I created. It is called Cobalt Solutions and it is a fake real website.
        it cannot be found on the internet, but yet it can. The website is video game hacks for the first person shooter, Warzone. I wrote the application with my friend on Python 10.3.4.
        I coded most of the application and my friend coded the rest, and made the website on HTML.
